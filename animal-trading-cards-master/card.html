			<p><i>The part of a dog's brain that is devoted to 
				analyzing smells is, proportionally speaking, 
				40 times greater than ours</i></p>

				<li> Found in the yard, the couch, and under the dinner table.</li>
				<li> Unique personalites </li>
				<li> Breeds with unique job specialties.</li>
				<li> Very loyal to their family</li>

			<p>The Dog is one of the most important animals on this planet. 
				They have lived alongside humans for thousands of years.
				Serving as guards of our flocks of sheep, herds of cows.
				Warning us with their sharp sense of smell. 
				The world would be a lot less special without our furry dog friends.
